Task 2 "dangerous minds"
Implement your own version of C++ vector - a dynamically reallocated array with table doubling. This could be implemented just for integers.
Your implementation should include functions for read and write access of elements,
appending, resizing (truncating if downsizing), deletion of one element or a segment of elements.
Test accumulated running time for appending for a large sequence of operations. Compare it with the same test for C++ vector.
Remember that time of element access should be O(1) and amortized time for element append has to be O(1).
